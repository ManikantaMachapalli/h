    <h1>Parents play a pivotal role in their childrens life.</h1>
    <h2>They are the pillars of support, guidance, and love.</h2>
    <h3>Parenting takes action long before a child's birth </h3>

    <h5>There is nobody like them who can shape and mould a child's behavior and development. </h5>
    <h6>Parenting is a never-ending skill. </h6>
